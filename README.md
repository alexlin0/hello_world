===========

Trick is developed on RHEL 6 and the free alternatives. (We use Scientific Linux)

Trick depends on quite a few packages.  To install these packages on yum based systems.

    > yum install bison flex gcc gcc-c++ java-1.7.0-openjdk libxml2-devel make openmotif \
      openmotif-devel python python-devel perl swig zlib-devel

In addition, clang/llvm is also required and not included and will have to be compiled from source.
